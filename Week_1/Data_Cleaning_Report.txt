Data Cleaning Report - Wind Energy Prediction (LSTM)
---------------------------------------------------

Dataset: Wind_Energy_Data_RAW.csv
Cleaned File: Wind_Energy_Data_CLEANED.csv

Overview:
The dataset contains wind turbine operational data used for predicting wind energy output.
It includes the following columns:
1. Date/Time – Timestamp of the data point
2. LV ActivePower (kW) – Actual power generated
3. Wind Speed (m/s) – Wind speed in meters per second
4. Theoretical Power Curve (KWh) – Predicted power from physics model
5. Wind Direction (°) – Wind direction in degrees

Cleaning Steps Performed:
1. Converted the "Date/Time" column to a proper datetime format.
2. Removed rows with missing or invalid data entries.
3. Removed any duplicate records.
4. Sorted the data chronologically.
5. Reset index for clean structure.

Summary:
- Original dataset shape: 50,530 rows × 5 columns
- Cleaned dataset shape: 50,530 rows × 5 columns
- Missing values removed: 0
- Duplicates removed: 0
- Final dataset is clean and ready for preprocessing and model training.

Target Variable:
- LV ActivePower (kW) — This is the output we aim to predict using the LSTM model.

Next Steps:
- Perform data normalization and feature scaling.
- Split dataset into training and testing sets.
- Build and train the LSTM model for energy prediction.
